# HeartDisease
The project of predicting heart disease for elder people(65+) based on multiple factor using machine learning.
As given in heart.csv file the factors in each column which responsible for heart disease in 65+ people.
1.age
2.sex
3.chest pain type (4 values)
4.resting blood pressure
5.serum cholestoral in mg/dl
6.fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl
7.resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)
8.maximum heart rate achieved
9.exercise induced angina
10.oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
11.the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
12.number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
13.thal: 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect

By using logistic regression on with 80% training sets and 20% testing we will achive target.
here target is 0 and 1.
where 1-> person having heart disease.
      0-> person not have any disease.
